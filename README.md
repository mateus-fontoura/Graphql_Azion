# Graphql_Azion

This code sends a GraphQL request to the Azion GraphQL endpoint and transforms the response into a pandas DataFrame. It then creates multiple charts showing data about the requests made to a web server, including the number of requests made per minute, the number of requests with different HTTP status codes, and the number of requests with different upstream status codes.
